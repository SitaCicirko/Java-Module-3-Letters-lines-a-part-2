# Java-Module-3-Letters-lines-a-part-2

Part 1
Write a program that puts 50 objects storing strings consisting of the letter 'a' 
repeated a random number of times (repeat range: 1-50) in the ArrayDeque queue.
Fill the object with repetitions of the letter 'a' using a for loop.

Part 2
Extend the program from the first part in such a way that you pass the created queue to the method of your class,
which will separate the objects from the queue into two ArrayList collections.
One will store objects with an even number of 'a' characters, and the other with an odd number.
